# Menu-Driven-CRUD-Application
This project is a menu-driven CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built in java. It allows users to manage a dataset.

Overview
This project is a menu-driven CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built in java. It allows users to manage a dataset (e.g., records of users, products, or any other entities) using a simple command-line interface (CLI). The application demonstrates how to implement core CRUD operations, providing a hands-on example of how data can be manipulated through basic user inputs.

Features: 

a.Create: Add new records to the dataset.
b.Read: View all or specific records.
c.Update: Modify existing records.
d.Delete: Remove records from the dataset.

Menu-Driven Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for navigating CRUD operations.

Validation: Input validation to prevent errors during record creation or modification.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: [Java]
Database/Storage: [e.g., File-based storage, MySQL]

How to Use:

Launch the Application: Once the application starts, you will see a menu with options to:

1. Create a Record: Enter the details to add a new record to the dataset.
2. Read Records: View all records or search for a specific record.
3. Update a Record: Modify the details of an existing record.
4. Delete a Record: Remove a specific record from the dataset.
5. Exit: Close the application.

Follow the Prompts: Select an option from the menu by entering the corresponding number and following the on-screen instructions to perform the desired operation.

CRUD Operations: All data entered through the menu will be validated and stored in the application's storage mechanism (e.g., file, database). Each operation can be executed as many times as needed during the session.
